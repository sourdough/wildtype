external dependencies as importable ES modules

see https://github.com/sourdough/starter

this repo simply tracks output for predictability: it is a bucket of ES modules not owned by this organization which are used as part of that org's work

useful for:
* predictability
* security, auditing
* work offline
* git-only dependency management
* bypass and remove all other non-git tooling across workflows, infrastructure, networks and systems
