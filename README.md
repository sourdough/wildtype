# wildtype
external dependencies as importable ES modules; this repo simply tracks output for predictability: it is a bucket of ES modules not owned by this organization which are used as part of the org's work and is useful for:

* predictability
* security, auditing
* work offline
* git-only dependency management: bypass and remove all other non-git tooling across workflows, infrastructure, networks and systems
